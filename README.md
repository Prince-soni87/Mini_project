<h1>❤️ AI-Powered Pricing Intelligence & Dynamic Revenue Optimization Platform</h1>
Project Overview

Pricing is a very crucial factor for the success of any business. If the price is set too high, it may lead to a decrease in sales, and if the price is set too low, it may lead to a decrease in profit.

This project is an AI-powered pricing intelligence system that helps businesses automatically determine the optimal price for their products.
The system uses demand, past sales, and market trends to provide optimal prices in real-time that can maximize revenue and profit.

This project is based on real-world systems that are used by companies such as Amazon, Uber, and Airbnb.
